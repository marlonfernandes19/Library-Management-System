# Library-Management-System

Library management system is a system which aims in 
providing a computerized system to maintain and coordinate the
functioning of a college library. This system is a web-based
application and provides a separate login and interface for both
librarians and students. 


This system consists of librarians as the Admin and students
as the user. The librarian can manage the account status of the student as well as
the book repository. The system will also provide the ability to issue books to
students by the librarian.
